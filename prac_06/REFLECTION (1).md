Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have probably became less diligent in my work since my last reflection. I have not been completing all the 
Practice & Extension Work however I am still competing the videos and all the practicals

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to start watching the videos earlier in the week to give me more time to do the prac work and therefor allow me
to do the extension work

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am doing well in watching and understanding the lecture content

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to make sure to get more ahead in lecture content earlier

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would have a dedicated tutor time. I know that we already a seminar and slack but a time to exclusively ask questions
in a way without time constraints with the ability to talk may be helpful I believe this must have once been a thing 
because there is stile references to a tutorial in some of earlier section where set up is explained.
I would also recommend that the seminars are recorded as although I know the point is to increases attendance for some
people it may not always be possible such as last week were engineers had a industry night
