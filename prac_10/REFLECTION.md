# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Yes they were usually accurate however there was a few that where significantly off

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As my accuracy was relatively high at the beginning they did not improve due my estimate remaining
approximately the same leve of accuracy with one task at the end that was about 3 times off at the end.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that a few mistakes or concepts that you do not full know or understand can demandingly effect
estimates accuracy.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learnt that my docstrings needed to be improved and reinforced that I need to put fullstops and 
uses the imperative voice

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learnt the importance of using logical and consistent variable and function names to make it easy
for others to read

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 07 feedback](https://github.com/JDMjcu/CP1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

My review gave a clear explanation of some of the things that could be improved issues to increase readability and
maintainability and comments that help to prevent confusion when calling functions and classes.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 05](https://github.com/jd115406/cp1404practicals/pull/1#event-18604425737)

### Explanation

Found errors that would prevent code from functioning and pointed out missing docstrings to improve maintainability.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would try to shorten the Programming project management task as this task took a very long time to compete
that may result in some people not doing the task or giving up halfway through. This was also one of the few
times I did not reserve a vie-view likely because of the length of the task and was one of the time I would have
most liked to have gotten one.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

While doing the subject I did well issuing I understood the concepts that where being tort and not take shortcuts.
